# Osu!Toy

*Pleasure is Just a Tap Away - Zak*

This is a custom build of osu!lazer that includes a custom mod for Buttplug.io support!

To use, make sure intiface is running and you have a device connected, then enable the `Toy` mod in mods menu, `and your motor is revved and VROOOM VROOOM AWOOOOOOGAHHH HUFFA HUFFA WAOOOOOOOOO`

## Config
This mod has a few config settings, and a few of them aren't super clear on what they do, so I'll document them here:

1. `Motor Speed Max` - The max speed all motors will be limited to. As you might expect, 1=100%, 0=0%.
2. `Combo Factor Max` - ~~~~

(I tried to put these in the game, but while the settings entries have a description option, the game doesn't seem to do anything with that for some stupid reason?)


## Shortcomings
Multi-device support is not good rn. Basically, it will run all connected devices, but the `Motor 0`s of each device will all be on the same setting. The good thing is that calling a motor beyond what a device is setup for has no consequences, so it's fine if multiple devices have different numbers of motors, but like I said they can't be configured independently.

I wrote this readme very late at night so if this doesn't make sense yell at me and I'll re-write it later (or you can!)
